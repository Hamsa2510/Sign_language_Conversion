PROJECT TITLE:
Sign Language to Text Converter using YOLOv5

This repository contains the dataset and code for the project "Sign Language to Text Converter using YOLOv5".
The aim of this project is to help bridge communication gaps by detecting sign language gestures in real-time and converting them into readable text.

📂 Contents

1).YOLOV5.v1\yolov5pytorch.zip – Pre-trained YOLOv5 model and related files.
2).yolov5.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with code to train, test, and run inference using YOLOv5 on the collected dataset.

⚙️ Project Overview

The model is trained to recognize specific sign language gestures.Once detected, the recognized gesture is converted into text for easier understanding and communication.
Built and tested using Google Colab.

✅ How to Use

1).Clone this repository.
2).Extract the ZIP file containing the YOLOv5 model.
3).Open and run yolov5.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
